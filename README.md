# Whispr: Real-time Communication Platform üí¨

Whispr is a modern microfrontend, full-featured real-time chat application designed for seamless communication. It provides robust user authentication, private messaging, and comprehensive group chat functionalities, all built within a high-performance monorepo architecture. Dive into a dynamic chat experience where connecting with friends and groups is intuitive and efficient.

## üöÄ Installation

Getting Whispr up and running on your local machine is straightforward. Follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, grab a copy of the project to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swag-blips/whispr-micro-frontend.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd whispr-micro-frontend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project uses `pnpm` and `Turborepo` for efficient dependency management. Ensure `pnpm` is installed globally (`npm install -g pnpm`). Then, install the monorepo's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Before running the application, you'll need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the `apps/auth` and `apps/host` directories.

**For `apps/auth/.env.local`:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL # e.g., http://localhost:3005/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
```

**For `apps/host/.env.local`:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL # e.g., http://localhost:3005/api
```

Replace `YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL` with the URL of your backend API (if separate) and `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Google OAuth client ID.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can run the application:

### 1. Start the Development Servers

From the root of the monorepo (`whispr-micro-frontend`), start both the authentication and host applications using Turborepo:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command will concurrently start the `auth` application (typically on `http://localhost:3007/auth`) and the `host` application (typically on `http://localhost:3006`).

### 2. Access the Application

*   **Authentication Portal**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3006/auth` in your web browser to access the signup and login pages.
*   **Main Application**: After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the main chat application, usually at `http://localhost:3006`.

### 3. Interacting with Whispr

*   **Authentication**: Sign up with email/password or use Google OAuth for a seamless login experience. Email verification and OTP-based login enhance security.
*   **Chat with Friends**: Once logged in, you can search for other users and send friend requests. Upon acceptance, you can initiate private one-on-one conversations.
*   **Group Chats**: Create new group chats, invite friends, and manage group details such as the group name and bio. You can also add or remove members as needed.
*   **Sending Messages**: Type your messages in the input field. The system includes typing indicators to show when someone is actively composing a message. Messages also display their status (sent, delivered, seen).
*   **Notifications**: Stay updated with real-time notifications for incoming friend requests and other important updates.

## ‚ú® Features
